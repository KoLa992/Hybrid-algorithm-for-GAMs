## Contents of this Folder
 * **resHibrid_BankClientsDefault_.xlsx** files: Excel files containing runtime results of the Hybrid Algorithm run on hardware configurations with different numbers of processor cores. End of the filenames indicate the number of processor cores used for the numerical experiment. In each case, 20 replications were executed. Structure of the Excel files is the same as the structure of the **resHibrid_BankClientsDefault.xlsx** file in the parent directory.
    * The file titled **resHibrid_BankClientsDefault_1core.xlsx** also contains the data necessary to estimate the proportion of execution time that the part in the Hybrid Algorithm benefiting from parallelization originally occupies for Amdahl's law.
 * **resHibrid_BankClientsDefault_1core_PopulationInheritanceData.xlsx**: Contains the number of individuals from inheritance for each examined population during the execution of the Hybrid Algorithm on 1 processor core. The data is necessary to estimate the speedup of the part of the Hybrid Algorithm that benefits from parallelization for Amdahl's law.
 * **ScalabilitySummaryTable.xlsx**: A summary table created by merging the summary statistics of the **resHibrid_BankClientsDefault_.xlsx** files. Some graphs are also added here.
