 * **BenchmarkModels_ExtraForPhD.R**: R script for running the extra benchamrk algorithms (Full GAM, DoublePenalty_v1,	DoublePenalty_v2,	Nonnegative Garrote,	Cosso,	Stepwise, Backward based on p-values,	Modified Backfitting,	GAMBoost) and for evaluating their runtimes, model results. Runtimes for each algorithm based on 20 replications are stored in the **RunTime_ExtraModels.xlsx** file.
